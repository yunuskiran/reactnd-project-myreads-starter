# MyReads

## About
I created this website as a project for React Nanodegree for Udacity. This project allows the user to keep track of books that have been read, are currently being read, or that user would like to read. Also user can search books and than add, remove or update your shelf. I forked starter project from [Udacity Myreads Starter Project] `udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter` and it uses Udacity's [BooksAPI.js](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/tree/master/src/booksAPI.js) which allows me to retrieve data from a mock server. 
It was build with the React and uses React's states. The main page includes three main shelves that user are able to move the books between shelves. The search page allows to user search books to add to own shelves. When user select an option, navigate back to the home page and see the selections made on the search page.
